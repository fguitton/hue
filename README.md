Hue Lumixury

The Hue app, simplified

Hue Lumixury is designed exclusively for Windows Phone. It features a simplified user interface and streamlined workflow, which allows for creating themes, customizing light bulbs, as well as creating schedules.

The code based on WinRT thus making the app universal. However at the time being the UI is for phones only, and so the app does not run on Windows tablets (yet theorically it can).
